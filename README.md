# calpupator = cpp calculator

## Numbers are prompted in 3 parts

- mantissa
- base
- exponent

> where: mantissa*base^(exponent)

This is because "numbers" in the context of the program are scientific numbers

## Valid operators: + - * / ^

## Multiply by a number like: 12.5^2

You have to input it like this:

- mantissa: 1
- base: 12.5
- exponent: 2
